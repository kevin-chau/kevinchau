Lately I've noticed that the price of Bitcoin has been heavily correlated with the overall sentiment in the stock market. This definitely wasn't the case in the last bullrun, and to me that signals that instituional investors are also now bullish on the medium-to-longterm value of BTC. 

Just earlier this year, [Tesla bought $1.5B in Bitcoin](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1point5-billion-in-Bitcoin.html), and despite [last week's dump in the stock market](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/stock-market-open-to-close-news.html) (which I believe led to Bitcoin's own price retracement), I'm still overall very bullish on the entire cryptocurrency market in general.

**For future reference, I'm just going to throw up my price prediction for Bitcoin here and a few reasons to back it up:**

> ### I believe BTC will reach $100,000 dollars per coin during this bullrun, and could even reach $500,000 dollars per coin in the next 10-25 years.

First of all, let's define when this could happen, which is more or less trying to call when the bullrun is over. This could be as early as the end of this month, based on the amount of mania I'm seeing in mainstream and social media -- check out the [crypto fear and greed index](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/) -- which could mean a smaller all time high of around 65-70k. 

Ideally, I'd rather see Bitcoin top out around December, giving time for the rest of the cryptocurrency market to price in longer term sentiment based around upcoming software developments in blockchain technology, namely a possible [De-Fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance) and [NFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) bubble, [Ethereum 2.0 Proof-Of-Stake](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/) rollout, [EIP-1559](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md) Fee Market Change, and the release of various L2 solutions. Now these are mostly just Ethereum developments, but I'm not ignoring the possibilities that other cryptocurrencies will try to copy these technological innovations, as we're beginning to see with the [Binance Smart Chain](https://docs.binance.org/faq/bsc/bsc.html), and disrupt the current cryptocurrency market.

Ethereum is really a whole other rabbit hole to fall into, so for now let's just assume this entire bullrun is being led by BTC price action alone, which is more or less true considering that Bitcoin has been holding it's ***60+%*** dominance in [total cryptocurrency market cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage). So, back to BTC price and why I think it's still got a long ways to go.

### I think $100,000 per Bitcoin is a realistic price target because that would put Bitcoin's market cap around $2T, which rivals the biggest market capitalizations in the entire stock market.
Not surprisingly, these leading market caps come from the big tech giants like [Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Tesla, and Facebook](https://www.tradingview.com/markets/stocks-usa/market-movers-large-cap/), among these only Apple having a market cap greater than **$2T**. That is to say, if Bitcoin reaches **$100,000 per coin**, it would have a total valuation greater than that of almost **every single company sold on the stock market**.

Now you might think that would be ridiculous, but now let's repeat this exercise for my other price prediction of **$500,000**. This would put Bitcoin at a total market cap of more than **$10T**, which is actually not unreasonable condering the market cap of Bitcoin's biggest competitor: [gold](https://companiesmarketcap.com/gold/marketcap/).

You may have heard Bitcoin is analogous to "Digital Gold", which is a comparison coming from Bitcoin's [store-of-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_of_value) narrative. If you're not familiar, this thesis essentially states that Bitcoin's increase in price is driven by its ever increasing scarcity. ***As more and more people buy Bitcoin up and demand for it increases, it becomes rarer and thus more valuable, which is pretty much the same reason why we give gold any value.*** The reason behind this scarcity is that the total number of [minable Bitcoin is finite and has been pre-determined](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/total-bitcoins), not to mention the growing amount of Bitcoin forever lost with absolutely no chance of recovery.

Of course, if the stock market were to completely collapse tommorrow, there is a very real chance that Bitcoin price would also collapse and go back to **$0**, because there are so many institutional investors this time around. Retail investment alone can only drive the price so far (the 2017-2018 bullrun all-time-high was around **$20,000**), even though we've seen just how powerful retail investors armed with social media and copious amounts of public internet data can be (see the recent [WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and [GME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze) movement from earlier this year).

All of this got me thinking-- How does Bitcoin's performance compare to the stock market performance in the last 5 years or so since it gained widespread adoption and acceptance? One way to do this is to compare the price of Bitcoin with any number of stock market indexes such as the [S&P500](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/) or [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EDJI/). Surprisingly, not much turns up when I googled "S&P500 vs BTC", so I went about compiling this data for myself. Luckily, this data is very easily accessed on Yahoo Finance, so I downloaded some CSVs and fired up my computer's spreadsheet application for the first time in years to make a quick little chart. Here are my results:

> #### S&P500 vs. BTC from 2014 to Present, logarithmic scale.

> #### DJIA vs. BTC from 2014 to Present, logarithmic scale.

### Okay, so what do these charts tell us?
Essentially, they show that Bitcoin is outperforming the US stock market, and could even continue to do so even if the stock market were to tank. I think this could also be used to show that in a future world where the US dollar is especially weak, the value of Bitcoin could soar even  higher. 

Of course, what do I know. I've never studied econmics and I am in no way particularly financially literate. It might make absolutely no sense to compare the price of Bitcoin to the value of a stock market index, but given that at some point in the past Bitcoin's dollar value was roughly the same as the decimal value of the S&P 500 and the decimal value of the DJIA, I thought it was a useful comparison for me to make and the data provided would be nice to visualize. At least for me.

**Again, someone experienced in the financial world would probably say that it's pointless to compare the price of any one asset or commodity to a stock market index**. But I do see plenty of gold-to-S&P500 ratio charts on the internet, so I thought why the hell can't I find or make my own comparisons with Bitcoin. Maybe I should've just plotted the market cap of Bitcoin vs the market cap of S&P or DJIA, but this seemed like harder information to compile. 

**All-in-all, these charts really don't say anything definitive, and should you analyze them, take them with heaps and heaps of salt.**

If you'd like to look at the data directly yourself, I've added the CSV files I made to the bottom of this post.

------------------------------------

Well that's about all I have to say about Bitcoin for now. I'm actually much more excited for Ethereum developments in the next few years, but lately I've been on a crypto trading kick so I wanted to put some ideas out there. See you in the next one!

***DISCLAIMER: Any viewpoint in this post is not financial advice nor investment advice and I am not suggesting that you buy Bitcoin at its current price or any price point for that matter. Be an adult and make your own decisions about what you like to spend your money on.***

## Programmer's note
Initially I had wanted to make these plots programmatically using python and it's plotting tools, but decided it would be much faster to just download the CSVs and do it by hand in a spreadsheet, for the purposes of writing up this blog post. A much better solution for all of this would be to create a new website which utilizes whatever public APIs are available so that users can see and interact with these charts in real-time. Perhaps I'll revisit this idea in a future project, but for now I'm just thinking of calling it `bitcoinversus.com`. Or maybe `etherversus.com` or `cryptoversus.com`. It could be a whole platform dedicated to comparing cryptocurrency prices to stock market indices.
