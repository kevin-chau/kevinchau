Hello! I've been diving into sound design and specifically FM synthesis lately with Operator and the Elektron Digitone. Today I made a fairly convincing electric piano in Ableton Live and I wanted to share it / post it to this blog for archiving. 

I followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV1to538r70) from Doctor Mix, which shows you how to make a classic EP sound using a Yamaha DX Reface. I'm surprised I was able to take the instructions and apply them to Operator, but I guess that shows I'm making good progress in learning general sound design concepts.

The sound is a little weak on the low end (any suggestions?), but I made a nice instrument rack with lots of controls so you can get get a wide variety of EP sounds fairly quickly. I even color coded the macros with classic KCHAU colors -- Enjoy!
